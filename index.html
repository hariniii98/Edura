            <p  class="sectionSubTag text-small">The purpose of a successful E-learning platform is that it creates a robust learning experience that feels like a classroom experience, offering the traditional classroom characteristics (like instructor-student interaction, Q&As, discussion, games, collaborative projects, quizzes, etc.) but either online or through a device (e.g. a laptop, desktop, tablet or mobile.) These important learning environments are achieved through a learning platform’s features and tools that create the level of interaction and engagement students need.Learning platforms should also include content modules, learning modules, evaluation modules, and communication modules, all of which we discuss in this article on Important Modules for an Efficient Learning Management System. These modules allow for your training program to incorporate a variety of teaching styles for every learner, and allows for learners to boost their performance level and knowledge-retention levels.</p>

That is a compound annual growth rate of 52%. The number of users enrolled for various online learning courses is estimated to be 1.6 Million in 2016, Which is expected to grow about 9.6 Million by the end of 2021. It is estimated that there is a 175% increase in the cost of classroom education, this gives online education more preferred because it is cost effective. Nearly 48% population in India between 15–40 age group with high aspirations but lower income is a good target market for online education. And, the acceptability of online channel is high in the younger demographic. The New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is designed to maximise the benefits of digital and online education in India while mitigating the downsides.

            <p  class="sectionSubTag text-small">Let's Grow Together is an organisation whose primary purpose is the establishment of educational, enjoyable and illuminating environmental projects within schools. Much of our work is aimed at establishing food-growing as a centrepiece to the activities of schools. We aim to educate children about the value of food-growing with a view to bringing about environmental, health, social and financial benefits. In addition, our activities extend into practical garden construction and maintenance including work outside of schools and the time-tabled school day. Food-growing has been a powerful strand in the history of Let’s Grow Together and it remains a core area of interest and work. Food-growing projects can be of interest, use and value to people of any background whether in a school setting or elsewhere. Let’s Grow Together can work in schools as well as beyond, in the wider-community, with vulnerable groups, social housing schemes and care homes amongst others. We can tailor projects in schools to meet the needs of any age-group, from KS1 to KS3.</p>
